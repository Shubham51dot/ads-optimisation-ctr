# Ads Click through rate(ctr) optimisation

### Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.

### In this dataset of  Ads CTR optimisation there are 10 columns representing the different ads and 10000 rows representing the users who clicked the ads
### we are going to use two types of methods to determine which ad is more reliable

###### 1. Upper-Confidence Bound action selection uses uncertainty in the action-value estimates for balancing exploration and exploitation.
###### 2. Thompson Sampling Thompson Sampling (Posterior Sampling or Probability Matching) is an algorithm for choosing the actions that address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in multi-armed bandit problem

### we got the result that from both of the techniques we got ad no 4 the highest value hence we select ad 4 for further use
